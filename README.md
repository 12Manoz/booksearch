# booksearch

The Book Search demonstration application is a full stack web application that allows the user to build and search a database of information about books. This application demonstrates how the Spring framework (in this case, Spring Boot and Spring MVC) can be used to build an application that uses AWS DynamoDB to store and search information. The Book Search application uses Java Server Page (JSP) server side rendering to build the web pages and display database search results.
